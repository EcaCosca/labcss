         <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
            be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
            favorites as well!

      <section class="Sec">
         <span> 1- Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
         C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
         to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</span> <br>
         <span>2- Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
         slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
         that it does not run off.</span>
         <br>
         <span>3- Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
         degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</span>
